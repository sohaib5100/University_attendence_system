## Project Overview

This project is a **University Attendance Management System** built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It features a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and uses **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** to interact with a MySQL database for storing and managing attendance data. The system is designed to streamline the attendance management process for professors and administrators in a university setting.

## Features

- **Student Registration**: Register student details (name, roll number, course).
- **Attendance Tracking**: Professors can mark attendance for each student in their classes.
- **Reports**: View detailed attendance reports, including attendance percentage and missed classes.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL database integration using JDBC for storing student and attendance records.
- **User Authentication**: Admin and professor login system for secure access.
- **GUI**: A simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface using Java Swing.
